## Resampling

### Balanced Accuracy Score review

The Random Over Sampler has the greatest Balanced Accuracy Score, but SMOTE and SMOTEENN are both within a few hundreths of a point. The Cluster Centroids is just above .5 so this would be the first model ruled out.

#### Balanced Accuracy Score: 
* Random Over Sampler = 0.65
* SMOTE = 0.64
* Cluster Centroids = 0.51
* SMOTEENN = 0.63

### Recall Score review



#### Recall Score:
* Random Over Sampler = 0.
* SMOTE = 0.
* Cluster Centroids = 0.
* SMOTEENN = 0.

### Geometric Mean Score review



#### Geometric Mean Score:
* Random Over Sampler = 0.
* SMOTE = 0.
* Cluster Centroids = 0.
* SMOTEENN = 0.


## Ensemble Learning

### Use the above to answer the following:

> Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?
>
> Which model had the best recall score?
>
> Which model had the best geometric mean score?
>
> What are the top three features?
